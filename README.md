First time here, follow these steps:
1. make sure you have MLOX installed
2. run it once, a file `mlox_base.txt` will be created
3. download all three files from this repo.
- `mlox_base.txt` replaces the one that was just created
- `mlox_user.txt ` goes in the exact same directory
- `Update_Rules.bat` goes in your MLOX directory
> You can also clone the github repo directly into your mlox directory and git fetch
the mlox repo has a gitignore file that is updated to work with mlox

Enjoy!
